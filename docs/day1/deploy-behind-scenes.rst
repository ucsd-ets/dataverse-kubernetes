=================
Behind the Scenes
=================

The below UML sequence diagram shows all necessary steps by "you"
(the user activity on the left) or (preferably) your deployment framework
(like Kustomize.io, Helm or similar) on your behalf for a new deployment of
Dataverse. It explains what happens in the background on an overview level.

When you are done with the initial deployment, you have to :doc:`bootstrap </day1/job-bootstrap>`
(and :doc:`configure </day1/config>`, which is done during bootstrapping, too).
